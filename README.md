# **Tic-Tac-Toe with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**

**INFO 6205 Spring 2025 Team Project**

## **Project Overview**

This project implements a **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**-based AI for playing **Tic-Tac-Toe**. The goal is to develop an intelligent agent that can efficiently explore possible moves and make optimal decisions using MCTS, a powerful algorithm for decision-making in games.

### **Key Features**

âœ… **MCTS Implementation** â€“ A simulation-based search algorithm for optimal move selection

âœ… **Generic Game Framework** â€“ Built using Java generics for extensibility

âœ… **Unit Testing** â€“ Ensures correctness and robustness

âœ… **Performance Analysis** â€“ Measures MCTS efficiency in decision-making

## **Project Goals**

1. **Understand MCTS** â€“ Learn how Monte Carlo Tree Search works and apply it to Tic-Tac-Toe.
2. **Implement & Optimize** â€“ Develop a functional AI player and explore optimizations.
3. **Extend to Other Games** â€“ The framework allows adaptation to other board games.

## **Technical Details**

### **Project Structure**

The code is organized into two main packages:

1. **`core`** â€“ Contains generic MCTS logic (`Game`, `Move`, `Node`, `State`).
2. **`tictactoe`** â€“ Implements Tic-Tac-Toe-specific rules and AI.

### **How MCTS Works in This Project**

1. **Selection** â€“ Traverse the game tree using a selection policy (e.g., UCB1).
2. **Expansion** â€“ Add new nodes for unexplored moves.
3. **Simulation** â€“ Play random games (rollouts) to estimate move strength.
4. **Backpropagation** â€“ Update node statistics based on simulation results.

## **How to Run**

### **Prerequisites**

- Java 18+
- Maven

### **Steps**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   bash

   Copy

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Build the project:**

   bash

   Copy

   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Tic-Tac-Toe game:**

   bash

   Copy

   ```
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.phasmidsoftware.dsaipg.projects.mcts.tictactoe.TicTacToeGame"
   ```

4. **Run unit tests:**

   bash

   Copy

   ```
   mvn test
   ```

## Performance & Optimization

- **Default MCTS** works well for Tic-Tac-Toe due to its small state space.
- **Optimizations** (if implemented) could include:
  - Heuristic-based rollouts (instead of random playouts)
  - Parallel simulations
  - Early termination conditions

## **Report & Evaluation**

The final submission includes:

âœ…  **Code implementation** (MCTS + Tic-Tac-Toe logic)

âœ…  **Unit tests** (high coverage required)

âœ…  **Performance analysis** (timings, optimizations)

âœ…  **Documentation** (README, rules, execution steps)

âœ…  **Optional** â€“ A demo video showing gameplay
